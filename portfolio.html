    <p1>I'm Robert Tibbs and this is my porfolio.  I am a East Carolina University graduate with a degree in Fianace with a concentration in Risk Management and Insurance.  I have been living in the greater Raleigh area for the past five years while working for a local insurance agency.  Over the past few years, I have thought about what I value in a career and what would drive me professionally.  A industry that values creativity and innovation, that requires a contstant thirst of knowledge and critical thinking, but understands failure and work life balance is an area I could thrive in.  These core values I found to be consisten in the tech industry but more specifically in development.</p1>
    <p2>In my spare time I enjoy spending time with friend and family, going to the gym, and following my favorite sports teams.  I currently comission a dynasty football league with twelve friends,  </p2>

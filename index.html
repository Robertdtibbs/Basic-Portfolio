            <p1>I'm Robert Tibbs and this is my portfolio.  I am a East Carolina University graduate with a degree in Fianace with a concentration in Risk Management and Insurance.  I have been living in the greater Raleigh area for the past five years while working for a local insurance agency.  Over the past few years, I have thought about what I value in a career and what would drive me professionally.  A industry that values creativity and innovation, that requires a contstant thirst of knowledge and critical thinking, but understands failure and work life balance is an area I could thrive in.  These core values I found to be consisten in the tech industry but more specifically in development.</p1>
